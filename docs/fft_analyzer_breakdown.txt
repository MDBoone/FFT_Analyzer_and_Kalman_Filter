Detailed breakdown of fft_analyzer.py

---

### Imports

import numpy as np
- numpy is imported for efficient numerical operations, especially for performing FFT and frequency calculations.

---

### FFTAnalyzer Class

Purpose:
- Provides methods to perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis on signals, extracting their frequency components.

---

__init__ Method

def __init__(self, sample_rate):
    self.fs = sample_rate

- sample_rate: Number of samples per second (Hz).
- self.fs: Stores the sampling rate for use in frequency calculations.

---

compute_fft Method

def compute_fft(self, signal):
    fft_vals = np.fft.fft(signal)
    freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(len(signal), d=1/self.fs)
    return freqs[:len(freqs)//2], np.abs(fft_vals)[:len(freqs)//2]

- signal: Input time-domain signal (array-like).
- fft_vals: Computes the FFT of the input signal.
- freqs: Calculates the frequency bins corresponding to the FFT result.
- Returns:
  - The positive frequency components (first half of the spectrum).
  - The magnitudes of those frequency components.

Summary

- The class allows you to analyze the frequency content of time-domain signals.
- You can specify the sample rate for accurate frequency axis calculation.
- Useful for digital signal processing and spectral analysis tasks.
